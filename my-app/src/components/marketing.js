                  <li>Ybor City, a historic neighborhood in Tampa, FL, became known as the "Cigar Capital of the World" in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, thanks in part to Cuban immigrants. These skilled artisans helped to establish and grow the cigar industry in the U.S., blending traditional Cuban techniques with new innovations.</li>
